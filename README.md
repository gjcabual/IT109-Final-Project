## 🚀 Features

### Inventory Management

- Real-time product stock tracking
- Automatic stock updates on order placement
- Product catalog with pricing and availability

### Order Management

- Shopping cart functionality
- Order creation and processing
- Order history tracking
- Real-time inventory validation

### User Interface

- Clean, modern design with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive layout for all devices

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Services

- `inventoryService`: Manages product inventory and stock levels
- `orderService`: Handles order processing and management
- `storageService`: Manages local storage operations

### State Management

- Global state management using Zustand
- Centralized store for products, orders, and cart
- Efficient state updates and subscriptions

## 📝 Code Organization

### Components

Each component is organized in its own directory with:

- Main component file
- Associated styles (if needed)
- Type definitions
- Unit tests

### Services

Services are organized by domain:

- Clear interfaces
- Single responsibility
- Error handling
- Type safety

### State Management

The store is organized with:

- Clear state interface
- Action creators
- Type-safe selectors
- Efficient updates

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm run test
```

Tests cover:

- Component rendering
- Service functionality
- State management
- Integration tests

## 🔒 Type Safety

The project uses TypeScript for full type safety:

- Strict type checking
- Interface definitions
- Type inference
- Generic types where appropriate

## 🎨 Styling

Styling is handled through:

- Tailwind CSS for utility classes
- Custom CSS modules where needed
- Responsive design patterns
- Consistent theming

## 🔧 Configuration

Key configuration files:

- `vite.config.ts`: Build and development settings
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS settings
- `eslint.config.js`: Linting rules
